      <p>Macedonian cuisine (Macedonian: Македонска кујна, romanized: Makedonska kujna) is the traditional cuisine of North Macedonia. It is influenced by Ottoman and Balkan cuisines. The relatively warm climate of the country provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its dairy products, wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as rakija. Tavče gravče and mastika are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia.</p>

<h4>Drinks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>Macedonian coffee, with lokum</li>
</ul>
<p>North Macedonia has a well-developed coffee culture, and Turkish coffee is by far the most popular coffee beverage. With over 5,000 establishments, the traditional Balkan coffeehouse and bar—the kafeana—is one of the most common places to go out and have a drink. However, because of the negative stereotypes surrounding the kafana, many younger people prefer to frequent the more Western-styled cafés which are also seen as being classier.

<p>Rakia (ракија) is the most popular alcoholic beverage in North Macedonia. It is a strong fruit brandy that is usually made from grapes, plums, apples, pears, cherries, or apricots. Rakia is commonly consumed as an aperitif before meals, and it is often served with a variety of traditional Macedonian appetizers known as meze. Mastika (мастика) is another popular alcoholic drink in North Macedonia. It is an anise-flavored liqueur that is typically consumed as a digestif after meals. Mastika has a distinct licorice taste and is often enjoyed chilled or over ice.</p>
